WireGuard: fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel.

## About

WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes
state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner,
and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache.

It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows,
macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable,
including via an Hass.io add-on!

WireGuard is currently under heavy development, but already it might be
regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution
in the industry.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
2. Install the "WireGuard" add-on.
3. Start the "WireGuard" add-on
4. Check the logs of the "WireGuard" add-on to see if everything went well.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "server": {
    "host": "hassio.local",
    "addresses": [
      "10.200.100.8/24",
      "10.10.0.1/16"
    ],
    "dns": [
      "8.8.8.8",
      "8.8.4.4"
    ],
    "private_key": ""
  },
  "peers": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "public_key": "",
      "allowed_ips": [
        "0.0.0.0/0"
      ],
      "persistent_keep_alive": 42,
      "endpoint": "demo.wireguard.com:51820",
      "pre_shared_key": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

## TODO: Document all configuration options
